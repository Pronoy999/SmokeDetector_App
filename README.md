# SmokeDetector_App
This is the app which can be used while making an Arduino Project. 
Suppose you want to make something which will create a alarm. Now there are ways of giving an alaram like ringing a bell or lighting a led.
But What if you want to send an sms to the user. The usual way to send an sms is connecting the mobile as a modem and then using
Microsoft Visual studio and using hyper terminal sending sms. But thats too diffcult. Incase I suggest another way, thats just connect    
Bluetooth module and then send an sms from the android phone with out needing it to connect it to the system.

This app receives the bluetooth data and then sends a predefined sms text to the mobile number already specified. 

I used this app for my project where I was required to detect smoke using some sensor and arduino and then notify the user. 
I was able to send a bluetooth text to the android app and then the app would send the SMS to the mobile number specified at the time of 
the initialization.  fewf
